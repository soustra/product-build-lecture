    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Lotto Number Generator! This website is a collection of fun and interactive tools designed to entertain and provide unique experiences.</p>
    <p>Our primary tool, the Lotto Number Generator, helps you generate random lottery numbers for various games. While it's designed for entertainment, we encourage responsible gaming. Remember that lottery games are based on chance, and there's no guarantee of winning.</p>
    <p>We also feature an "Animal Face Test" powered by Google's Teachable Machine. This tool allows you to upload an image and see if our AI model classifies it as a "dog" or a "cat." It's a lighthearted way to explore machine learning and is intended purely for amusement.</p>
    <p>We are continuously working to add more exciting and engaging tools to enhance your experience. Thank you for visiting!</p>
